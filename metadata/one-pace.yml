    summary: One Pace is a fan project that recuts the One Piece anime in an attempt
      to make the anime's pacing more bearable. The team accomplishes this by removing
      filler scenes not present in the source material. This process requires meticulous
      editing and quality control to ensure seamless music and transitions. One Pace
      includes everything that's in the manga, plus a little bit of anime only content
      where it's appropriate.

# One Pace Posters
Full credit for the season and parent posters goes to [u/Mizzoufan523](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mizzoufan523/), I just added them here to make it a bit more efficient to download / add to Plex through Kometa.

Theme was downloaded from [archive.org](archive.org), backgrounds were all downloaded from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org), logo was found from a quick google search.
